DESCRIPTION
    This program will convert a git branch to a svn ditto, it also support
    incremantal updates.

    git2svn takes a git fast-export dump and converts it into a svn dump
    that is feed into svnadmin load.

    git2svn assumes its the only process that writes into the svn
    repository. This is because of the race between getting the to svn
    Revsion number from the svn, creating the dump with correct Revsions,
    and do the svnadmin load.

    git2svn also support incremental updates from a git branch to a svn
    reprositry. Its does this by setting a git tag
    (git2svn-syncpoint-<branchname>) where the last update was pulled from.
