DESCRIPTION
    git2svn will convert a git branch to a svn branch, it also support
    incremental updates.

    git2svn takes a git fast-export dump and converts it into a svn dump
    that is fed into svnadmin load.

    git2svn assumes it's the only process that writes into the svn
    repository. This is because of the race between getting the to svn
    Revision number from the svn, creating the dump with correct Revisions,
    and do the svnadmin load.

    git2svn also supports incremental updates from a git branch to a svn
    repository. It does this by setting a git tag
    (git2svn-syncpoint-<branchname>) where the last update was pulled from.

    git2svn was created as a hack over a weekend to support a smoother
    migration away from svn and allow users access to tools to browse and
    search code (fisheye) and use anonymous svn servers.

EXAMPLES
            B<git2svn> ~/src/heimdal svn-repro

            B<git2svn> --git-branch heimdal-1-0-branch \
                 --svn-prefix branches/heimdal-1-0-branch \
                 ~/src/heimdal svn-repro
